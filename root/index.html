        <h3>Favorite Memory</h3>
        <p> 
            One of my <strong>many</strong> favorite memories of you is when I visted you and Sarah in New York when I was 16. I had so much fun riding the subway and watching 10 Things I Hate About You on your projector and trying Sarah and Meryl's chocolate banana bread! Thank you for taking me to the zoo to see the funny monkeys and to the magnificent Dairy Queen after riding the Staten Island Ferry! I need to visit you soon so we can go to comic book shops together.

        <h3>Gratitude</h3>
        <p>
            Thank you for everything you've done to make me feel loved and special. Thank you for teaching me how to ride a bike, painting my childhood bedroom walls, gifting me the love for reading and the passion for Spider-Man, encouraging my writing, Big Chungus, sharing salt and vinegar chips, making lemon cupcakes for Sarah's wedding, helping me from being caught in a riptide, and all the laughter.
