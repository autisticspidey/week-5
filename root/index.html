        <h3>Favorite Memory</h3>
        <p> 
            One of my <strong>many</strong> 
            <!--inline element bold--> 
            favorite memories of you is when I 
            visited you and Sarah in New York when I was 16. I had so much fun 
            riding the subway and watching 10 Things I Hate About You on your 
            projector and trying Sarah and Meryl's chocolate banana bread! 
            Thank you for taking me to the zoo to see the funny monkeys and 
            to the magnificent Dairy Queen after riding the Staten Island Ferry! 
            I need to visit you soon so we can go to comic book shops together. 
        </p>

        <h3>Gratitude</h3>
        <p>
            Thank you for everything you've done to make me feel loved and special.
             Thank you for teaching me how to ride a bike, painting my childhood 
             bedroom walls, gifting me the love for reading and the passion for 
             Spider-Man, encouraging my writing, Big Chungus, sharing salt and 
             vinegar chips, making lemon cupcakes for Sarah's wedding, helping me 
             from being caught in a riptide, and all the laughter.
